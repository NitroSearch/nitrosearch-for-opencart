/**
 * THE APPEARANCE LAYER, where being wrong is silent on every storefront.
 *
 * A `theme` key the widget does not read is assembled, serialised, sent, and
 * thrown away — no error anywhere. The sibling PrestaShop module shipped exactly
 * that for weeks (`onAccent` where the widget reads `accentContrast`), and the
 * only reason it was ever found is that another connector emitted the same value
 * under the right name. A cfg key has no schema on either side.
 *
 * So these assertions are about the CONTRACT, not the look: the names that go on
 * the wire, the values a hostile POST can and cannot store, and the fact that a
 * shop which has chosen nothing still gets a complete set of density tokens.
