/**
 * `window.NitroSearchConfig` plus the loader script, for the shop's `<head>`.
 *
 * THE LOADER IS ~1.3 KB AND FETCHES NOTHING UNTIL A SHOPPER SHOWS SEARCH INTENT.
 * It enhances the theme's own search input in place; the widget bundle is only
 * requested on the first focus or on a search-results page. A visitor who never
 * searches downloads the shim and nothing else, which is why it is acceptable to
 * put this on every page rather than on the search page alone — the widget has to
 * be attached to the header search box, and that box is on every page.
 *
 * FRAMEWORK-FREE, LIKE EVERYTHING IN src/. The shop's url, currency and language
 * are passed in: the two majors expose all three differently, and this class is
 * copied verbatim into both archives. {@see \NitroSearch\Sync\Runner::storefront()}
 * resolves them once, from the shop's own settings rather than from the ambient
 * request, so a page rendered for a logged-in customer emits the same config as one
 * rendered for a crawler.
 *
 * IT EMITS NOTHING UNTIL EVERY PIECE IS PRESENT. A connected-but-unverified shop
 * has no scoped key, and a loader on such a page is a script that can only fail —
 * so the whole block is withheld rather than emitted half-formed. Same for a shop
 * whose service has not yet told it where the bundles live.
